# Tribute-Ada-Lovelace
A tribute page dedicated to Ada Lovelace (part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design challenges)

After reading up on design, choosing colour palettes and fonts as part of my creating the "Survey for Potterheads" (another repository of mine), I went back and changed some of the styles on this webpage around, and I have to say I am a lot happier with this website now that I was previously. I chose a very bold colour scheme but I think it works quite well for this website considering the importance of its content and Ada's character :)
